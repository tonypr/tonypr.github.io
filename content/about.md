Hi, I'm Anthony E. Erb Lugo 👋🏻

I’m a software developer with a passion for math. Originally from Puerto Rico, I studied computer science and mathematics at MIT and have worked at both startups and big tech companies. This blog is where I share my thoughts on software engineering, math, and other topics I find interesting.
