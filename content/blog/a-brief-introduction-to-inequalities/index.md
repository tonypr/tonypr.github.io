Recently, I learned that Google created this pretty impressive tool, [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/), which allows you to create an AI generated podcast-like discussion on a topic. It gave me the idea to try it out on the book I wrote, ["A Brief Introduction to Inequalities"](./media/A%20Brief%20Introduction%20to%20Inequalities.pdf).

I'm pretty impressed with the result which just took a couple of minutes to generate! You can check it out below:
